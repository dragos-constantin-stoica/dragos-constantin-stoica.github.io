After a couple of years I decided it is the moment to invest time in my github blog 

## Why? 
-----

In my experience asking the right question is the most important thing. Yes more important than the answer or the journey towards the answer.
I have more than 20 years of experience in IT, Training, Reseach and professional life and I consider that I can share one idea each week here. It is for my personal and egocentric purpose, it will serve nobody in particular and have no specific goal, just a place to deposit my thoughts.

I will enjoy it, hope U2!
