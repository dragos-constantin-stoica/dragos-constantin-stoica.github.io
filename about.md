## Achievements


* [**CouchDB Book**](https://dragos-constantin-stoica.gitbooks.io/couchdb-just-relax-man/) 
   
   When I installed for the first time CouchDB, back in 2012, I got this astonishingly beautiful message from a software:  
   `Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax`  
   This was the first time when a software was designed for programmers and not for business or commercial people. Yes, I, as a programmer, I want to relax and have fun while spending hours and hours in front of my computer writing code! Coding must be fun and any programmer should enjoy doing it.
